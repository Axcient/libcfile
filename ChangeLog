* add fallback versions of
  - CreateFileA
  - CreateFileW
  - CloseHandle
  - ReadFile
  - WriteFile
  - GetFileAttributesA
  - GetFileAttributesW

* what about disk full on write errno = ENOSPC

Notes:
* WINAPI ReadFile
  When the file is UNBUFFERED it appears that nNumberOfBytesToRead must be a
  multiple of sector size. Any other value will result in error 0x57
  (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER).
