TODO
* Windows CRT functions
  - fix logic of definition of WINAPI CRT stat exists function
  - ioctl equivalent?
  - remove them all together?
* add file stream support
  - what about non-CRT WINAPI version ?
  - implement libcfile_stream_open_wide
* validate WINAPI versions of fallback functions
* add fallback versions of
  - CreateFileA
  - CreateFileW
  - CloseHandle
  - ReadFile
  - WriteFile
  - GetFileAttributesA
  - GetFileAttributesW
  - GetLastError
* add libcfile_codepage.h and codepage functions
* improve tests ?
  - add write when opened with read ?
  - add IO control tests ?
  - add test to retrieve size from device ?
* what about disk full on write errno = ENOSPC

Notes:
* WINAPI ReadFile
  When the file is UNBUFFERED it appears that nNumberOfBytesToRead must be a
  multiple of sector size. Any other value will result in error 0x57
  (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER).
